IAM is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.

It allows you to manage users, roles, and permissions to define who can access what within your AWS environment.

Free Service: IAM is offered at no additional cost

Global Service

Root account created by default, shouldnâ€™t be used or shared
 
Create Users: You can create individual user accounts for people who need access to your AWS resources.

Assign Permissions: You can assign specific permissions to users,groups, or roles to control what actions they can perform on AWS services.

Create Groups: You can group users together and assign permissions to the group, making management easier for multiple users.

Create Roles: You can create roles to assign temporary permissions to AWS services or users, especially useful for securely managing permissions across different AWS resources.

Define Policies: You can create and attach custom policies to define fine-

grained permissions for controlling access to AWS resources.

Manage Federated Access: IAM allows integrating with external identity providers (like Active Directory) for centralized management of user access across AWS.
